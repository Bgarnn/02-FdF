FdF - 3D Wireframe Graphics Representation

Welcome to FdF, a project that transforms elevation data into a captivating 3D wireframe representation. FdF, short for "Fils de Fer" or Wireframe in French, allows you to visualize landscapes in three dimensions, creating a stunning graphical representation of heightmaps.

** Project Overview **

- What does FdF do?
    - FdF takes a map as input, where each point represents a pixel with an associated height value. It then generates a 3D wireframe using this elevation data, providing a visually engaging representation of the terrain. This project is a beautiful fusion of mathematics and graphics programming, offering an immersive experience in the world of 3D graphics.

- Key Features
    - Interactive 3D Rendering: FdF renders an interactive 3D wireframe, allowing users to navigate through the landscape using mouse and keyboard controls.
    - Customizable Color Palette: Users can customize the color palette to add a personal touch to the graphical representation.
    - Map Projection: The project supports different map projections, providing flexibility in visualizing terrains from various perspectives.

- How to Compile FdF

To compile the FdF program, follow these straightforward steps:

  - Clone the Repository:
        - git clone git@github.com:Bgarnn/02-FdF.git
        - cd 02-FdF
  - Compile the Program:
        - make: This will generate the fdf executable.
  - Clean the Build:
        - make clean: This removes the object files, leaving only the compiled program.

** Now you can use FdF to create captivating 3D wireframe representations!

** Usage Example

./fdf maps/(map_name).fdf

(This will display the 3D wireframe representation of the provided map.)
